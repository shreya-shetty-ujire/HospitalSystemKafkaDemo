# Patient Discharge Event-Driven Service

## Overview

This project is a simple Spring Boot application demonstrating how to implement an **event-driven architecture** using Spring's built-in `ApplicationEventPublisher`. It simulates a **hospital patient discharge process**, where a discharge request triggers an event that can be handled asynchronously by listeners within the application.

The example shows how to decouple business logic by publishing and handling domain events without using external messaging systems like Kafka, making it lightweight and suitable for smaller or less complex use cases.

## Features

- REST API to initiate patient discharge requests.
- Uses Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher` to publish a `PatientDischargedEvent`.
- Listeners handle the event asynchronously to perform post-discharge tasks (e.g., notifying other departments, updating records).
- Demonstrates the use of Springâ€™s `@Async` annotation and `@EnableAsync` to process events asynchronously.
- Simple, maintainable, and extensible event-driven design.
